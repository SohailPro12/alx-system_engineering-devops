## Bash Scripting should not be used for:

- Heavy computational tasks
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) development
- Large-scale applications

## API (Application Programming Interface)

An API is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that developers can use to interact with a particular software component or service.

## REST API (Representational State Transfer API)

A REST API is a type of API that follows the principles of REST architecture. It uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. REST APIs typically use JSON or XML as the data format for exchanging information between the client and the server.

## Microservices

Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. Each service is designed to perform a specific business function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Microservices promote modularity, flexibility, and scalability in software development.

## CSV format (Comma-Separated Values)

CSV is a simple and widely used file format for storing tabular data. Each line in a CSV file represents a record, and fields within each record are separated by commas (or other delimiters, such as tabs). CSV files are commonly used for exchanging data between different applications, such as spreadsheets and databases.

Example:

```
Name, Age, City
John, 30, New York
Alice, 25, Los Angeles
```

## JSON format (JavaScript Object Notation)

JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript programming language and is commonly used for transmitting data between a server and a web application. JSON data is represented as key-value pairs and can be nested to create complex data structures.

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York"
}
```

## Pythonic Naming Conventions

- **Package and Module Name Style**: `my_module`
- **Class Name Style**: `MyClass`
- **Variable Name Style**: `my_variable`, `count`
- **Function Name Style**: `calculate_average`, `process_data`
- **Constant Name Style**: `MAX_VALUE`, `PI`

## Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python

- CapWords or CamelCase is used in Python to denote class names and other types of identifiers that represent classes or types. It helps differentiate class names from other identifiers like functions or variables.
- Following this convention makes the code more readable and consistent with Python's style guidelines (PEP 8).
