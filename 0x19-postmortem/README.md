Issue Summary:
On June 15th, 2023, at 2:00 PM UTC+1, XYZ Corporation experienced a significant data breach lasting two hours until 4:00 PM UTC+1. The breach compromised the personal information of over 10 million customers, resulting from a sophisticated cyberattack exploiting vulnerabilities in the company's network security systems(those hackers someone must punish them for real).

Timeline:
All times listed in UTC+1
2:00 PM - Cyberattack commenced, allowing hackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive customer data.
2:30 PM - Staff notified and investigation initiated.
3:15 PM - Engineering team investigated database servers and network connections, initially suspecting software updates or network congestion.
4:00 PM - Root cause identified: hardware failure in a database server. Faulty disk drive replaced, restoring database server operation.
( al long day hein!)
Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was a hardware failure in one of our servers, specifically a failed disk drive.

Resolution and Recovery:
Staff promptly set up a backup server, ensuring functionality through testing. Once verified, traffic was rerouted, and service was restored at 4:00 PM EST.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements:
- Enhance monitoring systems for better hardware failure detection.
- Implement redundancy in critical server components to mitigate future hardware failures.

Tasks:
1. Upgrade monitoring systems to provide real-time alerts for hardware failures.
2. Implement RAID configurations for critical servers to ensure redundancy in case of disk failures.
3. Conduct regular hardware maintenance checks to identify and replace aging components preemptively.
(now that we have done this let's see if hackers can make it through!üòÅ)
