### Specifics about the Infrastructure:

1. **What is a server?**
   - A server is a physical or virtual machine hosting the entire web infrastructure for foobar.com.

2. **Role of the domain name:**
   - The domain name is a human-readable address used to access websites, like www.foobar.com.

3. **Type of DNS record for www.foobar.com:**
   - The DNS record for www.foobar.com is typically an "CNAME" record (Canonical Name Record).
   - The DNS record for foobar.com is typically an "A" record (Address record).

4. **Role of the web server:**
   - The web server (Nginx, in this case) receives and handles HTTP requests from users' browsers. It serves static files, manages connections, and can act as a reverse proxy, directing requests to the appropriate backend servers.

5. **Role of the application server:**
   - The application server hosts the application's codebase. It processes dynamic content, interacts with databases, applies business logic, and generates responses to user requests forwarded by the web server.

6. **Role of the database:**
   - The database (MySQL) stores and manages the website's structured data. It handles data storage, retrieval, and management, allowing the application server to perform operations on the stored data.

7. **Communication between the server and the user's computer:**
   - The server communicates with the user's computer through the HTTP protocol. When a user accesses www.foobar.com, their browser sends an HTTP request to the server, which processes the request and sends back an HTTP response containing the requested web content.

### Issues with this Infrastructure:

1. **SPOF (Single Point of Failure):**
   - The single server represents a SPOF. If it fails, the entire website becomes unavailable.

2. **Downtime during maintenance:**
   - When maintenance, updates, or code deployments are needed, the web server typically needs to be restarted. This leads to downtime, making the website inaccessible during the update process.

3. **Scalability limitations:**
   - This setup might struggle to handle high traffic volumes.
