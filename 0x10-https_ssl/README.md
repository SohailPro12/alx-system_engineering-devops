# HTTPS and SSL

## Main Roles of HTTPS SSL
HTTPS SSL has two main roles:
1. **Authentication:** It verifies the identity of the website, ensuring that the user is connecting to the intended website.
2. **Encryption:** It secures the data transmitted between the user's browser and the website, protecting it from unauthorized access.

## Purpose of Encrypting Traffic
The purpose of encrypting traffic is to ensure that the information exchanged between the user's browser and the website is secure and cannot be intercepted by malicious actors. This helps safeguard sensitive data such as login credentials, personal information, and financial details.

## SSL Termination
SSL termination refers to the process of decrypting the encrypted traffic at the server or a dedicated security device, allowing it to be processed in an unencrypted form within a secure environment. This enables the server to access and manipulate the data before re-encrypting it for further transmission.
